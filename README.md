## Introduction

The topic we're reporting on is global suicide rates. The dataset that we're using for this analysis is Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 and can be found here:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016 "Kaggle").

This dataset contains the suicide rates of all the countries from 1985 to 2016 and has the following attributes.

	country - Country in the world
	year - Year for which data is shown
	sex -Gender description (i.e. male, female)
	age - The cluster of age group
	suicide_no - Number of suicides
	population - Population of the country
	suicides/100k pop - The number of suicides per 100k population
	country-year - country-year composite key
	HDI for year - Human Development Index for that year
	gdp_for_year ($) - GDP of the country for that year (USD)
	gdp_per_capita ($) - GDP per capita for that country (USD)
	generation - The generation of a particular group

As global suicide rates are increasing, we chose a dataset that provides enough data with a wide range of attributes that can demonstrate a correlation between
key socio-economic factors (i.e., the status of particular groups) and suicide rates. Since this dataset provides socio-economic background for each nation on 
the basis of years, we can attribute increased/decreased sucicide rates among different groups within a particular time, generation, country, etc. Therefore, 
the collection of such data can demonstrate certain indicators of increased suicide rates, which is useful in the cause of suicide prevetion. 


## Discussion
This dataset compiles suicide rates from each country ranging from 1985-2016. The suicide rates are attributed to each country, year, sex, age, GPD, population and generation. On the basis of suicide prevention and prediction, we must look into these values to negate, or find a correlation between the trend of suicide rates against multiple variables. This dataset helped us determine such trends. For instance, we have deduced that males make up the majority of the global suicide rate, at a significant percentage of 78.9% vs 21.1% for females. This proportion is demonstrated in each country. Thus, men face an increased risk of suicide rates. This may be attributed to the stigma regarding mental health, particularly men’s mental health, as societal standards may defer at risk men from seeking help or finding ways to cope with mental health. Despite the disproportion between men and women, both sexes follow the same trend (increase/decrease) of suicide rates throughout the years. 

Furthermore, the older generations face an increased risk of suicide, with the Silent Generation at 33%, Boomers, Gen X, and G.I. Generation at approximately 20% each. Throughout the range of years, those 75 years and older have the highest suicide rate overall. While all age ranges, generations, and sexes follow the same trend of suicide rates, there are certain in years in which the suicide rate peaks. Since 1985, the suicide rate has been increasing steadily. We can attribute the growth in population to this, of course, however; there are more factors than simply an increase in suicide rates due to population increase that we must consider. Initially, we decided to determine whether there existed a correlation between the GDP per capita and suicide rates. Assuming wealthier countries exhibited decreased suicide rates was false. Instead, countries with a greater GDP were those with higher suicide rates than those with a lower GDP. So, given that a country’s accumulation of wealth is not an indicator of suicide risk, we investigated other factors. For instance, the time period in which suicide rates spike are significant factors such that certain world events can be attributed to this. From the data, we have seen that the global suicide average increases drastically after 1990 and peaks in 1995. This is also where we see the increase of male-dominated suicides, whereas during this time period, the female rate actually decreases slightly. Thus, we compiled a chart of the countries with the highest suicide by total population average, and have seen that the top countries are the Russian Federation, Lithuania, Belarus, Lativa, Hungary, Kazakhstan, etc. All the countries are post-Soviet and have formed from the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. We can infer that such a drastic world event has sparked unrest following its ethical, and economic disintegration.  Moreover, 2002 and 2003 display high sums of the total global suicide rate. A major world event preceding this was 9/11. After 2003, the total amount of suicides declines slightly, then peaks again in 2009, following the stock market crash in 2008. Thus, we can attribute an increase in suicide rates to the effects of global crisis, societal unrest, and economic disintegration. 


## Conclusion
In this project, the concept is to analyze statistically significant data on suicide rate. All in all, we see that the details show what we see in the newspapers, on television and so on, in our view many of the conclusions we reached were already predicted; just think of the tremendous number of teen suicides, never seen in the data.

- The data illustrates that middle aged adults, between the ages of 30 through 60, have the highest suicide count. While elderly and adolescents have about half the amount as middle aged adults.
- Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among all Americans adults. Data show alarming differences in suicide for different sexes. It’s evident that males are more inclined to suicide, than females. In addition, Mental health is a major predictor for suicide.
- Young people age between 15-29 are at the highest risk among all age groups.
