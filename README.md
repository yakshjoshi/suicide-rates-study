## Introduction

The topic we're reporting on is global suicide rates. The dataset that we're using for this analysis is Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 and can be found here:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016 "Kaggle").

This dataset contains the suicide rates of all the countries from 1985 to 2016 and has the following attributes.

	country - Country in the world
	year - Year for which data is shown
	sex -Gender description (i.e. male, female)
	age - The cluster of age group
	suicide_no - Number of suicides
	population - Population of the country
	suicides/100k pop - The number of suicides per 100k population
	country-year - country-year composite key
	HDI for year - Human Development Index for that year
	gdp_for_year ($) - GDP of the country for that year (USD)
	gdp_per_capita ($) - GDP per capita for that country (USD)
	generation - The generation of a particular group

As global suicide rates are increasing, we chose a dataset that provides enough data with a wide range of attributes that can demonstrate a correlation between
key socio-economic factors (i.e., the status of particular groups) and suicide rates. Since this dataset provides socio-economic background for each nation on 
the basis of years, we can attribute increased/decreased sucicide rates among different groups within a particular time, generation, country, etc. Therefore, 
the collection of such data can demonstrate certain indicators of increased suicide rates, which is useful in the cause of suicide prevetion.
