## Introduction

The topic we're reporting on is global suicide rates. The dataset that we're using for this analysis is Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 and can be found here:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016 "Kaggle").

This dataset contains the suicide rates of all the countries from 1985 to 2016 and has the following attributes.

	country - Country in the world
	year - Year for which data is shown
	sex -Gender description (i.e. male, female)
	age - The cluster of age group
	suicide_no - Number of suicides
	population - Population of the country
	suicides/100k pop - The number of suicides per 100k population
	country-year - country-year composite key
	HDI for year - Human Development Index for that year
	gdp_for_year ($) - GDP of the country for that year (USD)
	gdp_per_capita ($) - GDP per capita for that country (USD)
	generation - The generation of a particular group

As global suicide rates are increasing, we chose a dataset that provides enough data with a wide range of attributes that can demonstrate a correlation between
key socio-economic factors (i.e., the status of particular groups) and suicide rates. Since this dataset provides socio-economic background for each nation on 
the basis of years, we can attribute increased/decreased sucicide rates among different groups within a particular time, generation, country, etc. Therefore, 
the collection of such data can demonstrate certain indicators of increased suicide rates, which is useful in the cause of suicide prevetion. 


## Discussion

## Conclusion
In this project, the concept is to analyze statistically significant data on suicide rate. All in all, we see that the details show what we see in the newspapers, on television and so on, in our view many of the conclusions we reached were already predicted; just think of the tremendous number of teen suicides, never seen in the data.

- The data illustrates that middle aged adults, between the ages of 30 through 60, have the highest suicide count. While elderly and adolescents have about half the amount as middle aged adults.
- Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among all Americans adults. Data show alarming differences in suicide for different sexes. It’s evident that males are more inclined to suicide, than females. In addition, Mental health is a major predictor for suicide.
- Young people age between 15-29 are at the highest risk among all age groups.
